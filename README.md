# 🦊 Fagun

**Give any AI a browser to use your product like real customers, run full UAT, hunt real bugs, and tell you if it's ready to ship.**

Fagun is a single tool that plugs into **Claude, Cursor, Codex, Antigravity, Windsurf,
Cline, or VS Code**. Once it's set up, you just type **`fagun`** (or `/fagun`) and your
AI can open a real browser and:

- **Use the site as real end users** — mobile, slow-internet, low-end, keyboard-only,
  screen-reader, international, first-time visitor — with real device + network emulation.
- **Understand the business first** — map the target's CTAs, forms, navigation,
  auth state, and likely revenue/conversion flows before judging it.
- **Run User Acceptance Testing** — walk complete journeys (signup, login, search,
  checkout, password reset…) step by step and confirm a real user can finish them.
- **Fuzz every input field** — valid, invalid, negative, empty, whitespace,
  special-character, unicode, boundary, and injection-observation cases.
- **Hunt real, reproducible bugs** — broken links, console/JS errors, failed requests,
  form-validation gaps, accessibility violations, slow pages, security misconfig.
- **Deliver a product-readiness verdict** — a 16-category scorecard (UX, UI, business
  logic, a11y, perf, security…) and a release decision, with prioritized fixes.

You set it up **once**. It works in **every** AI tool. Chrome installs **itself**.

## No model API key required

Fagun does not require users to bring a Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or other
model API key. It runs inside the AI app the user already chose. Claude, Codex,
Antigravity, Cursor, Windsurf, or a local MCP-capable model does the reasoning;
Fagun supplies the browser, QA, security, evidence, and report tools.

For plain-English browser tests, ask your AI:

```text
fagun https://example.com: search for "pricing" and verify results load
```

The AI should call `autoqa_prompt(url, goal)`, create a small plan with its own
model, then execute it with Fagun tools like `navigate`, `click`, `fill`,
`screenshot`, `get_console`, and `get_network`. Fagun should open Chrome through
Chrome DevTools MCP automatically when the AI client exposes it, using the user's
default Chrome session. It should only fall back to Fagun's browser if Chrome MCP
is unavailable or attach fails, and the fallback should be shown in the report.
Fagun remains the main tool and report brand, but it should call installed
supporting MCPs when useful. Jam MCP should be used when available for each
important Interactive Test Flow step and for reproducible bugs, attaching a
screenshot or screen recording with console/network context. At the end it should
call `autoqa_write_html_report` to create a branded HTML report under
`./reports/`, then open the returned Report URL with Chrome DevTools MCP/default
Chrome. The report includes project name, collected target URL, opened website
logo, full prompt, Fagun Tools title, Interactive Test Flow steps, per-step
evidence, Jam links/recordings, bugs, and fixes.

Supporting MCPs are routed by job:

- **chrome-devtools**: real/default Chrome session, logged-in testing, DevTools console/network/performance, report opening.
- **jam**: per-step screenshots/screen recordings and visual bug evidence.
- **playwright**: isolated/headless regression runs, multi-context checks, downloads/uploads, PDF/export checks, stable screenshots, trace/video-style automation.
- **mcp-fetch**: static page/API/header/robots/sitemap fetching without changing browser state.
- **context7**: current framework/library docs before fix advice that depends on library behavior.
- **virustotal** and **shodan**: optional authorized security intelligence when API keys are configured.
- **LangGraph or similar host-side orchestration**: useful for durable state,
  branching, retries, reviewer loops, or multi-agent test plans. Fagun remains
  the execution/reporting layer.

## ⚡ One command sets up everything

**Recommended, no Python needed:**
```bash
uvx fagun init
```

**Already installed but still seeing old output? Force the newest release:**
```bash
uvx --upgrade --reinstall fagun init
```

**If you prefer pip/Python:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade fagun
fagun init
```

That's the whole install. `fagun init` installs the Chrome engine **and** auto-detects
every AI tool on your machine (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf)
and registers the fagun browser tools, **Chrome DevTools MCP**, **+** the `/fagun`
skill in each one. It also opens `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging` so Chrome
can show the official **Allow remote debugging?** popup when Fagun attaches to
your signed-in default Chrome session.

The setup output is a modern CLI dashboard: task, progress table, configuration
files, final summary, and next commands. Paths are shortened with `~` so users can
see exactly what changed without reading noisy logs.

If your terminal still says `Fagun init — setting up everything…`, you are running
an old cached package. Refresh it with `uvx --upgrade --reinstall fagun init` or
`pip install --upgrade fagun && fagun init`.

Then restart your AI tool and type **`fagun`** — followed by what you want tested.

After setup, use Fagun inside your AI tool:

```text
fagun deep test https://example.com
fagun security scan https://example.com
fagun check links on https://example.com
fagun test the signup form on https://example.com
```

<details>
<summary>Other ways to install</summary>

**Paste-prompt** (let the AI do it):
> Install and set up **fagun** for me: install `uv` if missing, then run `uvx fagun init`.
> Follow https://github.com/mejbaurbahar/fagun/blob/main/install.md if anything fails.

**Claude Code plugin:**
```
/plugin marketplace add mejbaurbahar/fagun
/plugin install fagun@fagun
```

**Target one tool:**
```bash
uvx fagun install claude-code   # or: cursor | claude | vscode
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Don't have <code>uv</code> yet? (one line, no Python needed)</summary>

**macOS / Linux:** `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
**Windows:** `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`
Then restart your terminal.
</details>

---

## 🚀 Manual install (any OS — no Python or pip needed)

**Step 1 — install `uv`** (it brings its own Python, so nothing else is required):

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```
> ⚠️ **Restart your terminal** after this so `uv` is on your PATH.
> (macOS/Linux: or run `source $HOME/.local/bin/env` in the current shell.)

**Step 2 — set up Fagun:**
```bash
uvx fagun init       # installs browser + wires AI tools + Chrome DevTools MCP + /fagun skill
```

That's it. Restart your AI tool, type **`fagun`**, and go.

> **Already have `pip`/Python?** Run `pip install --upgrade fagun && fagun init`.

> 💡 Don't want to think about config? Just tell your AI:
> *"Install and set up fagun for me — follow https://github.com/mejbaurbahar/fagun/blob/main/install.md"*
> and it does everything above for you.

## 🔌 Connect it to your AI tool

Every tool gets two MCP servers:

- **fagun** — UAT, bug hunting, security, a11y, forms, reports.
- **chrome-devtools** — official Chrome DevTools MCP for live DevTools debugging,
  console/network inspection, DOM/CSS inspection, and performance traces.

`uvx fagun init` writes both automatically. Manual config:

| Tool | How |
|------|-----|
| **Claude Code** | `claude mcp add fagun -- uvx fagun` and `claude mcp add chrome-devtools -- npx -y chrome-devtools-mcp@latest --auto-connect --no-usage-statistics` |
| **Claude Desktop** | add the JSON below to `claude_desktop_config.json` |
| **Cursor** | `uvx fagun install cursor` (writes `~/.cursor/mcp.json`) |
| **VS Code (Copilot)** | `uvx fagun install vscode` (writes `.vscode/mcp.json`) |
| **Windsurf / Cline / Antigravity** | paste the JSON below into their MCP settings |
| **Codex CLI** | add the TOML below to `~/.codex/config.toml` |

```jsonc
// Claude Desktop / Cursor / Windsurf / Cline / Antigravity
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fagun": { "command": "uvx", "args": ["fagun"] },
    "chrome-devtools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "chrome-devtools-mcp@latest", "--auto-connect", "--no-usage-statistics"],
      "env": {
        "CHROME_DEVTOOLS_MCP_NO_USAGE_STATISTICS": "1",
        "CHROME_DEVTOOLS_MCP_NO_UPDATE_CHECKS": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```toml
# Codex — ~/.codex/config.toml
[mcp_servers.fagun]
command = "uvx"
args = ["fagun"]

[mcp_servers.chrome-devtools]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "chrome-devtools-mcp@latest", "--auto-connect", "--no-usage-statistics"]
env = { CHROME_DEVTOOLS_MCP_NO_USAGE_STATISTICS = "1", CHROME_DEVTOOLS_MCP_NO_UPDATE_CHECKS = "1" }
startup_timeout_ms = 20_000
```

The `-y` flag prevents `npx` from asking the user to confirm package download.
`--auto-connect` makes Chrome DevTools MCP attach to the user's running Chrome.
On first setup, Fagun opens `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging`; turn on remote
debugging there, then click **Allow** when Chrome shows the permission popup.
Users do not need to run `fagun connect to my Chrome` first; `fagun deep test <url>`
should auto-use Chrome DevTools MCP when the AI client exposes it.
If the target is still logged out, Fagun checks `auth_status`: the user can log in
manually in Chrome, or provide authorized test credentials for `login_with_credentials`.
Passwords are masked in output and the resulting session can be saved for future
authenticated tests.
Fagun opts out of Chrome DevTools MCP usage statistics and update-check noise in
generated configs.

**Restart the tool after adding it.** Then type `fagun`.

## 🎬 See it in action

▶️ **Live animated demo (macOS / Windows / Linux):** https://mejbaurbahar.github.io/fagun/#see-it-in-action

Setup + first bug on each OS:

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh   # get uv (once)
uvx fagun init                                     # browser + all AI tools + skill
# then, inside your AI tool, type:
#   fagun deep test https://example.com
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"   # get uv (once)
uvx fagun init                                     # browser + all AI tools + skill
# then, inside your AI tool, type:
#   fagun audit https://example.com
```

That's the whole flow: **install uv → `uvx fagun init` → type `fagun <task>`** in any AI tool.

## 💬 How to use it

Just talk to your AI in plain English:

- `fagun` → shows the menu and starts up
- `go to example.com and take a screenshot`
- `run QA on https://example.com`
- `deep test https://example.com and save the report to ./report.md`
- `check for broken links on https://example.com`
- `test the forms on the signup page`
- `are there any console errors?` · `any failed network requests?`
- `log in with test@x.com / password123, then check the dashboard`

### 🕵️ The `/fagun` bug hunter

Fagun ships with a skill that turns your AI into a methodical QA tester. It sweeps
the full product-readiness surface and only reports bugs it can actually reproduce
(no guessing):

| # | Checks for |
|---|-----------|
| 1 | **Functional** — broken journeys, buttons/links that lie |
| 2 | **JavaScript errors** — crashes, console errors on load & on click |
| 3 | **Network / API** — 4xx/5xx, failed calls, mixed content |
| 4 | **Forms** — missing validation, insecure submission, no labels |
| 5 | **Auth / sessions** — login errors, leaks, access control |
| 6 | **Accessibility** — missing alt text, labels, keyboard traps |
| 7 | **Performance** — slow loads, heavy resources |
| 8 | **Visual / responsive** — layout breakage, overflow, cut-off text |
| 9 | **Security** — missing CSP/HSTS, exposed versions, secrets in code |
| 10 | **SEO / discoverability** — titles, H1s, metadata, crawlability |
| 11 | **UX / product clarity** — confusing flows, blockers, weak empty states |
| 12 | **Business logic** — wrong outcomes, bad totals, broken lead/checkout paths |
| 13 | **Mobile / desktop parity** — breakpoint and device-specific failures |
| 14 | **Keyboard / screen-reader use** — focus order, traps, labels, contrast |
| 15 | **Headers / CORS / CSP** — browser security posture and misconfigurations |
| 16 | **Edge cases** — reloads, back button, huge inputs, unicode, offline-ish states |
| 17 | **AI/security orchestration** — optional safe tool planning for deeper authorized tests |

Every finding comes with **steps to reproduce, what was observed, and the impact.**

## 🪙 Token-saving (on by default)

Browser tools normally flood your AI's context with huge JSON blobs and full
network/console dumps — burning tokens fast. Fagun is built to be **token-lean**:

- **Terse output by default** — compact one-line-per-finding text instead of pretty
  JSON (~70% fewer tokens per result). Set `FAGUN_TERSE=0` for full JSON, or pass
  `verbose=true` to any tool for one call.
- **One call, not ten** — `deep_test` crawls + checks console, network, forms,
  headers, a11y, perf across the whole site in a **single** tool call, instead of
  many manual `navigate` + `get_console` + `get_network` round-trips.
- **Capped & deduped** — long link/console/network lists are truncated with a
  `+N more` marker; duplicate findings are collapsed.
- **Reports go to disk, not context** — pass `report_path` and raw detail is
  written there; the final chat answer still shows the full user-facing result:
  verdict, all findings, evidence, fixes, coverage, and report link.

> 💡 Cheapest workflow: `deep test <url> and save the report to ./report.md`
> → one call, full Fagun answer in chat, raw evidence/report on disk.

## ⚙️ Options (optional)

Set these as environment variables if you need them:

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `FAGUN_HEADLESS` | `1` | Set to `0` to **watch** the browser work |
| `FAGUN_BROWSER` | `chromium` | Use `firefox` or `webkit` instead |
| `FAGUN_CDP_URL` | — | Attach to **your own** open Chrome, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:9222` |
| `FAGUN_TERSE` | `1` | Compact token-lean output. Set `0` for full JSON or `mini` for extra-short summaries. |
| `FAGUN_FINDING_CAP` | `40` | Max findings shown per page in chat output. Full report still goes to disk. |
| `FAGUN_PAGE_CAP` | `12` | Max pages shown in multi-page chat summaries. |
| `FAGUN_DETAIL_CHARS` | `100` | Max chars per finding detail in terse output. |
| `FAGUN_URL_CHARS` | `60` | Max chars per URL in terse output. |

For the lowest-token workflow, use:

```bash
FAGUN_TERSE=mini
```

Then ask: `deep test <url> and save the report to ./fagun-report.html`. The chat
gets a tiny summary; the full evidence stays in the report file.

## 🎨 Fagun Style (same output across models)

Fagun ships a reusable response contract so Claude, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, Qwen,
DeepSeek, or a custom wrapper can show results in the same style:

- `fagun_style_prompt` — copy into system/custom instructions for Markdown output.
- `fagun_style_prompt(mode="json")` — tells the model to return structured JSON.
- `fagun_style_schema` — JSON schema for a frontend renderer with cards/panels.
- `fagun_render_response` — converts JSON or plain text into Fagun-style Markdown.

Default sections: Executive Summary, Problem, Analysis, Solution, Implementation,
Test Cases, Edge Cases, Risks, Production Impact, API Validation, Performance,
Jira Ticket, and Final Recommendation.

## 🧠 Advanced security prompt + tool catalog

For deeper authorized bug-hunting workflows, Fagun now includes an AI security
engineer prompt and an external-tool catalog. It does **not** blindly run exploit
tools; it plans adapters, explains when each tool fits, and keeps execution
scope-gated:

- `fagun_security_prompt` — improved enterprise prompt for authorized security testing.
- `list_external_security_tools` — catalog for Loxs, Skill Security Scanner,
  Shannon, Lonkero, recon-skills, payload corpora, RFC822 Email Validator,
  LostFuzzer, img-payloads, customBsqli, BeeXSS, TimeVault, and NextSploit.
- `recommend_security_tools` — picks the smallest relevant tool plan from the
  target profile and goal, then tells the AI how to validate and report evidence.

Use it for attack-graph planning, tool selection, deduplication, validation,
remediation, and regression tests. Active probes still require authorization.

`recon-skills` is treated as a read-only methodology pack first: Fagun can use it
to pick relevant recon, red-team, sector, chain, SAML, Docker, WordPress, CORS,
XMLRPC, JS-secret, metrics, and API-flow checklists, then translate those into
authorized Fagun-safe test plans.

---

## 🔐 Security scanning (authorized targets only)

`security scan <url>` runs the bug classes hunters get paid for — **non-destructive**,
GET/HEAD only, no attacks on third parties:

- Exposed files (`/.git`, `/.env`, `/.aws/credentials`, backups, actuator)
- Leaked secrets in HTML/JS (AWS, Stripe, Google, GitHub, JWT, private keys)
- CORS misconfiguration · reflected-XSS candidates · open redirect · SQLi error signals
- Cookie flags · security headers (CSP/HSTS/X-Frame)

> ⚠️ Only scan sites you own or are authorized to test.

## 🔌 Use your own logged-in Chrome (self-healing + sessions)

- Chrome DevTools MCP uses `--auto-connect` during normal deep tests, so it can
  reuse your already-signed-in default Chrome after you allow remote debugging.
  Great for testing behind a login without giving credentials to the AI.
- If Chrome is not logged in, Fagun reports `login-required` and asks for manual
  login or authorized test credentials. `login_with_credentials` records the
  login action trace but prints the password only as `[hidden]`.
- `connect to my Chrome` is only a troubleshooting fallback that launches a
  dedicated debuggable Chrome profile and attaches to it.
- `browser_exec` → when no built-in tool fits, the AI writes Python against the live
  page (full Playwright). `save_helper` persists what works, so Fagun gets smarter
  every run.

## 🧰 Everything it can do (MCP tools)

`fagun_start` · `product_map` · `auth_status` · `login_with_credentials` ·
`open_browser` · `navigate` · `click` · `fill` · `press_key` ·
`screenshot` · `evaluate_js` · `get_console` · `get_network` · `crawl` · `run_qa` ·
`check_links` · `test_forms` · `fuzz_forms` · `list_test_data` · `perf_audit` ·
`a11y_audit` · `security_headers` · `security_scan` · `advanced_security` ·
`deep_test` · `full_qa_sweep` · `write_report` · `browser_exec` · `save_helper` ·
`list_helpers` · `load_helper` · `connect_chrome` · `fagun_security_prompt` ·
`list_external_security_tools` · `recommend_security_tools` · `close_browser`

**What's new in v0.7.0 — deeper, smarter, evidence-backed:**
- **`fuzz_forms`** — actively fills every form field with a labelled test-data
  catalog (valid / invalid / negative / empty / whitespace / special character /
  unicode / boundary / out-of-box / injection) and reads the browser's *real*
  Constraint-Validation verdict. Reports include a field-by-field scenario matrix
  and screenshots for failed cases. A validation gap is reported only when the
  browser itself accepted a value it should have rejected.
- **`perf_audit`** — real Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, TBT, FCP, TTFB) from the
  browser's Performance APIs + a Lighthouse-comparable 0-100 score. No estimates.
- **`a11y_audit`** — deep WCAG 2.1 checks incl. real computed color-contrast.
- **`advanced_security`** / bigger `security_scan` — CSP quality, clickjacking,
  risky HTTP methods, mixed content, missing SRI, sensitive-page caching, host-
  header injection, CRLF, path-traversal/LFI, SSTI, command-injection, GraphQL
  introspection, error/stack-trace disclosure, sensitive-data-in-URL.
- **Jira bug reports** — every confirmed finding in Markdown/HTML reports gets a
  Jira-ready ticket: summary, priority, severity, steps, observed, expected,
  impact, evidence, screenshot path, and suggested fix.
- Every finding carries **evidence** — nothing is fabricated; unreproducible = not reported.
